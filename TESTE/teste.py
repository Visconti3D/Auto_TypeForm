    About me
    I graduated as architect and urbanist in 1999, and since then I work with computer graphics as a 3DS Max expert. In the last couple of years, I have decided to start a BTech in Software Development to upgrade my code skills. Nowadays I work at Rede Globo Television, as Sr. Illustrator developing a wide range of designs (2D/3D motion graphics, character animation, and 3D assets for RT applications) and a few tools and scripts for workflow automatizations.
